YA-DOS:  has magic
HDBDOS:  C101 will be a NOP... 
SDC-DOS: dff0 will be "dd e4 de a4"


From Darren A., concerning using SDC-DOS's dw routines:


The ROM contains vectors to the four I/O routines starting at $DFF0:

$DFF0 = CoCo 2/3 receiver
$DFF2 = CoCo 2/3 transmitter
$DFF4 = CoCo 1 receiver
$DFF6 = CoCo 1 transmitter

During initialization, SDC-DOS 1.2 stores either $DFF0 or $DFF4 in RAM at $0076.  Calls to the routines are then performed like this:

  ldu   $0076
  jsr   [2,u]     call transmitter
  ...
  jsr   [,u]      call receiver


Please note that the use of RAM locations $0076-77 may change in future versions, but the vector locations ($DFFx) are to remain the same.
